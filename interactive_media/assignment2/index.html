<!-- My whole layout was inspired by the Apple Music page. -->
<!-- Short introduction: I made an online album player with 6 of my songs, and then I designed the album 
 cover myself. The album cover is in black, white and grey with two fonts. The first one is designed by 
 myself through Adobe Illustrator, mainly to create a spider web effect, which means that the music in 
 my list covers a wide range of genres, but in fact they are all created or collected around me. No matter 
 what direction I go, it all comes back to one centre. The second font is a kind of graffiti, first of 
 all because I like street culture very much, and secondly I think this font is also very good at blending 
 with the spiderweb effect fonts, and still maintains a certain degree of clarity, so I used this font. 
 For the background I chose a river and its tributaries. The reason is the same as the spider's web, the 
 starting point is a centre, and different music genres represent different tributaries.

In terms of music selection, I chose songs that I composed myself and bought the copyrights for myself, 
the lyrics were not put into consideration of the memory problem, so it's all pure music inside, and their 
categories probably cover pop, jazz, R & B and hip-hop, all of which are genres I usually listen to more, 
and at the same time are genres that I would go for.
I chose black and grey for the colour of the theme as it focuses the viewer more on the music and doesn't 
steal their attention away from the theme. On the icon, I only used the simple pause and play buttons, 
instead of the cut button, because I want the audience to listen to the music quietly. At the same time, 
the song you press will play the corresponding track, which also replaces the cut button to some extent. 
My progress bar is movable, just to make it easier for people to listen to only one part of the song in 
particular.
