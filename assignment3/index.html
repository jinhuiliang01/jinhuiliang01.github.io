<!-- Because I am a semi-professional singer, and then I hope to take up some work after work. 
 That's why I created this website, hoping to promote my music. So there will be my name and contact 
 information, which is directly linked to my Instagram account. In terms of functionality, I've used 
 some knowledge from a creative coding class I'm taking this semester such as arrow functions, modulo and 
 data attributes, and in terms of style, I've gone for a minimalist look, considering the variety 
 of album covers. At the same time, I hope that the first thing the viewer sees on my website is my 
 artwork. Then for the timeline button on the player I chose black to match the overall black colour.

I was inspired by a rmit digital media online exhibition created by Adrian 
(https://2024.rmitdigitalmedia.com/) and then he used three.js to create this 3D effect, 
which I don't need to use to have a similar effect. I also added a rollover effect so that the site 
doesn't have to jump to another page to view my work, which adds to the convenience. Then Adrian's 
style was influenced by the material because he was a graduation exhibition, so he collected a lot of 
people's works and could only stack them up, he couldn't just lay them out flat like I did. In terms 
of the choice of style, all of them are unanimous in choosing a minimalist style. Because we wanted to 
highlight our own work rather than the website itself, we didn't want to steal the limelight from these 
works. The interactions were very different. His work is hovered over and pre-selected, and then 
clicking on it opens up the corresponding student's work on the website. Mine is just hover and click 
to play, without going to another site. This has to do with the material as well, as mine are audio 
files that don't need to be opened on other platforms. But his work contains video, website, audio and 
other kinds of material, so it can only be used as a relay station for users to navigate to other 
platforms.

And then for the interaction, I wanted to satisfy people's need to browse in a simple way, not through 
a lot of interactions like games or click-and-select. So the overall operation is not navigation, 
basically you can know how to operate it by touching it, and it's not too complicated experience. 
There are some websites that use a lot of interactive content to attract viewers, but mine is mainly 
about content, so I don't do too much interactive content, it's just appropriate.
