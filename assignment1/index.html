        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?

      <p>
        When I move my mouse across the page, it has a trailing white line that
        follows the mouse, which is the first thing I notice.
      </p>

      <li>
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </li>

      <p>
        Firstly, as the pulley rolls down, a series of texts can be seen in the
        form of a newspaper screen at the end of the film, which is roughly a
        synopsis of what they are about. Then scroll down again and you'll see a
        change from vertical to horizontal movement. And I noticed that with the
        wheel fixed, the colour of the mouse's background is different on the
        left and the right. Then finally change from horizontal to vertical
        again, and then a large several title will appear, and a preview will
        appear when the mouse hovers over the title, and the angle of
        inclination of the preview image is determined by the angle you move the
        mouse.
      </p>

      <li>
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </li>

      <p>
        The final part. That is, when the several header appears and the mouse
        hovers over the header, a preview will appear, and the angle of
        inclination of the preview will be determined by the angle you move the
        mouse.
      </p>

      <li>
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </li>

      <p>Drag trails that follow the mouse when it moves.</p>

      <li>
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        The idea is to make the audience stay longer in a cool and eye-catching
        way. Find out what their UX/UI direction is and what they're working on.
      </p>

      <li>
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </li>

      <p>
        From the interaction, it's eye-catching. Then the text arrangement and
        font selection are cool in their own way. When hovering the mouse, there
        is a preview image, we can choose our favourite items to open, so we
        don't have to guess what each one is about. I think his purpose is
        achieved.
      </p>

      <li>
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </li>

      <p>
        There were 3 sessions in total, each lasting about 2-3 minutes. It's
        very eye-catching, so I'm willing to stay longer and watch it over and
        over again.
      </p>

      <li>
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </li>

      <p>
        Mainly on projects, when someone needs to co-operate on a project, they
        will think of the cool web page they have visited, which attracts
        attention and is more memorable than a traditional web page. Because
        this interactive experience is not the same for every web page.
      </p>

      <li>
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </li>

      <p>
        There is a video of him playing in the background, but the tone is grey
        and not too eye-catching, so it can be separated from the front text.
      </p>

      <li>
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        I can also learn his form to make my own webpage. If I want to make a
        webpage about myself in the future, I can use a similar format to add
        interactivity and attractiveness to make others remember.
      </p>

      <li>
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </li>

      <p>
        There is an urge to go deeper. It's just that I'd be more interested in
        finding out exactly what it does and what the content is.
      </p>

      <li>
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </li>

      <p>
        At first it was confusing, and it took a bit of fiddling to realise that
        the form of interaction was through pulleys.
      </p>

      <li>
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </li>

      <p>
        The overall presentation is very integrated, fits the theme well, and
        then is very cool. Even the video at the back doesn't take away from the
        main text and introduction.
      </p>
